# Evaluation and Validation of ML Models Module - IBM
## Objectives:
- Explain common evaluation metrics for classification models and their use in assessing model performance
- Evaluate classification models using confusion matrices and performance metrics
- Describe regression model metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² score
- Assess the performance and feature importance of a Random Forest regression model
- Interpret evaluation strategies used in unsupervised learning, including heuristics for clustering quality
- Apply cross-validation techniques to validate models and reduce overfitting
- Compare the impact of regularization techniques on regression performance and feature selection
- Build optimized models using pipelines and hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Identify risks such as data leakage and explain their impact on model validity
